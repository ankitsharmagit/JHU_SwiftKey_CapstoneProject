Overview:

1.The goal of this app is to predict the next word, given a partial English sentence.  

2.This Shiny app was developed for the *Capstone Project*  of the 
[Johns Hopkins Coursera Data Science 
Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1?utm_medium=listingPage). This Capstone Project is designed in partnership with [Swiftkey](http://swiftkey.com/).


3.This app uses english text files (Twitter feed, blogs and news), samples them and builds Corpus corpus by tokenization, removing Stopwords, punctuation.

4.Analyze a large corpus of text documents to discover the distribution and relationship between the words, tokens, and phrases in the text.

5.Builds predictive model using n-gram stupid backoff model (Fourgram is first used; If no Fourgram is found, back off to Trigram; If no Trigram is found, back off to Bigram; If no Bigram is found, back off to the most common word ‘the’).

6.Builds Text Predict shiny App and deploys it on shinyapps.io


Prediction Algorithm - Stupid Backoff:

1.Stupid backoff method is used to predict the next word based on the collected n-gram.
In stupid backoff, if a higher order n-gram has a zero count, we simply backoff to a lower order n-gram, weighed by a fixed weight. In my shiny app, a fixed weight of 0.4 is used, which is suggested by Brants et al. (2007).

2.This algorithm uses the model below to calculate a score for each predicted word:

3.My Shiny App first uses the last three words typed in and looks in four-gram that match those three words. Then it backoff to the last two words typed in and searches for trigram that match those two words, and continue to the bigram. Also scores are calculated for all matching next words. The top 5 matches with the highest scores are listed as the word possibly coming next. If it is unable to find any match, the App returns the top-5 most likely unigrams.



The Shiny App:

1.The link for the Word Prediction App is: https://ankitsh.shinyapps.io/NextWordPredictor/

2.Just type in a few words,wait a few seconds, and a table showing five predicted words with their corresponding probablity will pop up.
